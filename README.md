# Tic-Tac-Toe vs CPU game
Just a small tic-tac-toe C++ console game

## How to run this game?
Just download the main.cpp file or copy and paste the code into an IDE. There are no dependencies.

## How to play?
You will always go first. The program will ask you to input a number between 0 and 8 (to signify the 9 spaces on the tic-tac-toe board) 

After you input your first choice, the CPU will randomly choose a space on the board that is not already occupied. Then it will be your turn again and so on.... until either you or the CPU has taken three space diagonally, horizontally or vertically first.
